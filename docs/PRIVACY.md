To identify users for moderation commands (!ban, !kick, !timeout, !unban, !softban), display user-specific information (!userinfo), and track command usage.

- **Retention** Stored as long as the bot is in a shared server with the user, or as necessary for moderation logs.

###  **Discord Guild (Server) IDs**
- **Purpose** To identify the server where commands are executed, manage server-specific settings (e.g., welcome/goodbye channels, auto-roles), and enable server-specific functionalities.
- **Retention** Stored as long as the bot remains in the respective Discord server.

### Discord Channel IDs
- **Purpose:** To designate specific channels for features like welcome messages (!setwelcome), goodbye messages (!setgoodbye), and to send command responses.
- **Retention** Stored as long as the bot remains in the respective Discord server and the setting is active.


### Discord Role IDs

## 2. How Information is Used
**The information collected by Blåhaj Bot is used exclusively to provide and improve the bot's functionality, including:**

## 3. Data Storage and Security

- **This database is not directly accessible to the public.**
- **We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures designed to protect the information we collect from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.**
