# ---- 1. Content Guidelines ----

- **No NSFW content: Sharing of sexually explicit, graphically violent, or otherwise inappropriate content is strictly forbidden in all channels. This includes images, videos, GIFs, and links.**

- **No illegal content: Do not promote, discuss, or share content related to illegal activities (e.g., drug use, piracy, hacking).**

- **No self-promotion (unless permitted): Do not advertise your own content, social media, or other Discord servers without explicit permission from a staff member.**

## --------------------------------------------------------------------


# ---- 2. Channel Usage ----

- **Stay on topic: Post messages in their designated channels. Read channel descriptions before posting.**

- **Use threads for specific discussions: For in-depth conversations on a sub-topic, please utilize Discord's threading feature to keep main channels clean.**

- **No excessive caps lock: Avoid using all capital letters in your messages frequently.**

## --------------------------------------------------------------------

# ---- 3. Conduct & Enforcement ----

- **Listen to Staff: Server staff (Admins, Moderators) have the final say in all matters related to server conduct and rule enforcement. Arguing with staff decisions in public channels is prohibited. If you have a concern, please message a staff member privately.**

- **Report Rule-Breakers: If you witness someone breaking a rule, please report it to a staff member. Do not engage in arguments with them directly.**

- **No loophole abuse: Attempting to find "loopholes" in the rules to justify inappropriate behavior is not allowed and will be treated as a rule violation.**

- **Private messages: While we cannot moderate private messages, remember that harassment or threats sent via DM can still result in a server ban if reported and verified.**

## --------------------------------------------------------------------

# ---- 1. Respect and Harassment ----

- **Be respectful: Treat all members with respect. Harassment, personal attacks, hate speech, discrimination (based on race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, etc.), or any form of bullying will not be tolerated.**

- **No spamming or excessive @mentions: Do not flood channels with messages, images, or unnecessary pings.**

- **Keep it clean (mostly): While some light profanity may be tolerated, excessive or directed profanity, slurs, and highly explicit content are prohibited.**
